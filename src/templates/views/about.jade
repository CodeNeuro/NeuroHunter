			| Goal

		p
			| Effective and reproducible data analysis requires validating methods against standard data sets. 

		p
			| In neuroscience, new analyses are repeatedly developed to solve problems faced by nearly all researchers. But comparisons between algorithms are rarely standardized across the community, or systematically vetted. Here we consider the "source extraction" problem: identifying neurons from time-varying image sequences. There are many existing algorithms but they have yet to be compared on standard data sets with ground truth.

		p
			| Our project has three core components:

		ul
			li.list-normal
				| All algorithms will be run in a <em class="callout">standard environment</em>, with a standardized format for both input data and algorithm output. We hope this integrates what has thus far been a disparate collection of implementations.

			li.list-normal
				| We will compute benchmarks on a <em class="callout">regular basis</em>, so that researchers can quickly find out how their algorithm performs across many data sets with a variety of metrics. 

			li.list-normal
				|	All algorithms will be provided by and for the <em class="callout">community</em>, and our GitHub-integrated submission system ensures that all algorithms will be immediately available and usable.

		br

		p
			| For this initial effort we have chosen a narrow focus: mouse two-photon calcium imaging with genetically encoded calcium indicators (e.g. GCaMP6). We will soon expand to incorporate other imaging modalities (light-sheet imaging, light-field imaging) and other species (zebrafish).

			| Data

		p
			| Data sets have been generously prepared by the following individuals and labs (more will be added as available):

		ul

			li.list-name
				| Simon Peron and Karel Svoboda

			li.list-name
				| Adam Packer, Lloyd Russel, and Michael Hausser

			li.list-name
				| Philipp Bethge and Fritjof Helmchen

		br

		p
			| In our standardized input format, data are organized into a folder with the following contents:

		pre
			code.
				info.json 
				images/image_t0.bin
				images/image_t1.bin
				...
				images/conf.json
				sources/sources.json

		p
			| The 
			span.inline-code 
				| info.json
			| file contains metadata like contributors and imaging method (see an 
			a(href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/neuro.datasets/challenges/neurofinder/00.00/info.json")
				| example
			| )

		p 
			| The 
			span.inline-code 
				| images
			| folder contains one flat binary file per time point and a
			span.inline-code 
				| conf.json
			| binary format specifcation:

		pre
			code.
				{
					"dims": [x,y],
					"dtype": "uint16"
				}

		p
			| Finally, the
			span.inline-code 
				| sources.json
			| file contains describes the identified neurons using the following format:

		pre
			code.
				[
					{
						"id" : 1,
						"coordinates": [[x0,y0], [x1,y1], ...],
						"values": [v0, v1, ...],
						"bbox" : [xx,xy,yx,yy],
						"centroid" : [x,y]
					},
					...
				]

		p
			| where the key properties are 
			span.inline-code 
				| coordinates
			| , the list of coordinates of pixels included in that source, and  
			span.inline-code 
				| values
			| , an optional list of non-zero weights on those pixels.

		p
			| All sources have been manually vetted and curated, and for a subset of datasets they are based on an ground-truth anatomical nuclear marker. Several training data sets in exactly this form are available through the 
			a(href='http://datasets.codeneuro.org')
				| CodeNeuro data repository 
			| to be used for algorithm development. Performance of submitted algorithms will be computed on test data, similar in kind to, and representative of, the training examples.

			| Who

		p
			| NeuroFinder is a community effort!

		p
			| The standard formats and evaluation metrics were decided at the 
			a(href='http://codeneuro.org/2015/NYC')
				| CodeNeuro NYC 
			| hackathon, with contributions from Simon Peron, Adam Packer, Logan Grosenick, Nicholas Sofroniew, Darcy Peterka, Patrick Kaifosh, Jeff Zaremba, Ben Poole, Sophie Aimon, Tim Machado, Eliza Chang, and many others. 

		p
			| This website and automatic job runner was also begun at the hackathon and further developed by Matt Conlen, Maxwell Rebo, Jeremy Freeman, Michael Broxton, Aero Wang, and Yangbo Du.
