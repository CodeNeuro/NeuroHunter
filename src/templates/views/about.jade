			| Goals

		p
			| Effective and reproducible data analysis requires validating methods against standard data sets.

		p 
			| A key step in analyzing neural imaging data is the identification of neurons from time-varying image sequences: "source extraction". Many algorithms aim to solve this problem, but they have yet to be compared on standardized data sets with ground truth or gold standard.

		p
			| By running in a <em class="callout">standardized environment</em> and imposing some minimal structure on algorithm inputs and ouptuts, we hope to integrate what has thus far been a disparate collection of implementations. 

		p
			| By comparing <em class="callout">multiple algorithms</em> across the same data sets, and presenting evaluation metrics in a leaderboard, we hope to understand how and why different algorithms perform â€” and which ones perform the best!

		p
			|	By requring that all algorithms are made <em class="callout">open source</em>, we will faciliate integration into user-facing analysis libraries after the competition ends (for example, into Thunder's Source Extraction API).

			| Data

		p
			| Data sets have been generously prepared by the following individuals and labs (more coming soon):

		ul

		li.list-name
			| Simon Peron and Karel Svoboda

		li.list-name
			| Adam Packer, Lloyd Russel, and Michael Hausser

		li.list-name
			| Philipp Bethge and Fritjof Helmchen

		br

		p
			| For this initial competition we have chosen a narrow focus: <em class="callout">mouse two-photon calcium imaging</em> with genetically encoded calcium indicators (e.g. GCaMP6). We will soon expand the competition to incorporate other imaging modalities (light-sheet imaging, light-field imaging) and other species (zebrafish).

			| Evaluation

		p 
			| For all data sets, we have a collection of spatial regions identifying individual neurons, in the following JSON format:

		pre
			code.
				[
						{
								"id" : 1,
								"coordinates": [[x0,y0], [x1,y1], ...],
								"values": [v0, v1, ...],
								"bbox" : [xx,xy,yx,yy],
								"centroid" : [x,y]
						},
						...
				]

		p
			| These regions have been manually vetted and curated for all data sets, and for a subset of the data they have been confirmed through a ground-truth anatomical nuclear marker.

		p
			| A large collection of training data with both images and sources are available through the 
			a(href='http://datasets.codeneuro.org')
				| CodeNeuro data repository 
			| for developing algorithms. During evaluation, your algorithm will be run on a subset of held-out test data, similar in kind to and representative of the training examples. The following metrics and stats will be computed for each dataset and algorithm:

		ul

		li.list-name
			| Accuracy (comparing spatial centers)

		li.list-name
			| Overlap (comparing spatial regions)

		li.list-name
			| Distance (average distance from true centers)

		li.list-name
			| Count (number of detected regions)

		li.list-name
			| Area (number of detected regions)

		br

		p
			| You can read more about these metrics by browsing the 
			a(href='http://thunder-project.org/thunder/docs-dev/')
				| documentation 
			| of Thunder's Source Extraction API, in particular the 
			span.inline-code
				| Source
			| and 
			span.inline-code
				| SourceModel
			| classes.

			| Reward

		p
			| Currently, there is no monetary reward for the highest ranking, only personal glory, and knowing you are helping to solve a challenging problem in neural analysis! In future competitions we may add other rewards.

			| Who

		p
			| NeuroFinder is a community effort!

		p
			| The standard formats and evaluation metrics were decided at the 
			a(href='http://codeneuro.org/2015/NYC')
				| CodeNeuro NYC 
			| hackathon, with contributions from Simon Peron, Adam Packer, Logan Grosenick, Nicholas Sofroniew, Darcy Peterka, Patrick Kaifosh, Ben Poole, Sophie Aimon, Tim Machado, Eliza Chang, and many others. 

		p
			| This website and automatic job runner was also begun at the hackathon and further developed by Matt Conlen, Maxwell Rebo, Jeremy Freeman, Michael Broxton, Aero Wang, and Yangbo Du.
