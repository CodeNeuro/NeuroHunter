# local training data

Several training datasets are available for direct download and local testing. Each downloadable dataset includes metadata (as `.json`), images (as `.bin`), and coordinates of identified neuronal sources aka ROIs (as `.json`). Most datasets are a few GBs large.

Links to the data sets are as follows (with lab of origin)

Each download also includes example loading scripts in `python` and `MATLAB`, the source code of which is in this repository. To contribute example loading scripts in other languages, just submit a PR to this repo!
