# local training data

Several training datasets for the [NeuroFinder](http://neurofinder.codeneuro.org) analysis benchmarking system are available for direct download and local testing. Each downloadable dataset includes metadata (as `.json`) images (as `.bin`) and coordinates of identified neuronal sources aka ROIs (as `.json`). Most datasets are a few GBs large. Checkout the list of downloadable [datasets](https://github.com/CodeNeuro/neurofinder/blob/master/local/datasets.md) and also browse [datasets.codeneuro.org](http://datasets.codeneuro.org) under the "challenges" category.

Along with the data, each download includes example loading scripts in `python` and `MATLAB`, the source code of which are in this [reposistory](https://github.com/CodeNeuro/neurofinder/blob/master/local/). If you want to contribute example loading scripts for other languages, just submit a pull request!
