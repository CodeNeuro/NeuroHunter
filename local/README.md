# local training data

Several training datasets for the [NeuroFinder](http://neurofinder.codeneuro.org) analysis benchmarking system are available for direct download and local testing. Each downloadable dataset includes metadata (as `.json`), images (as `.bin`), and coordinates of identified neuronal sources aka ROIs (as `.json`). Most datasets are a few GBs large. See the list of available datasets in [datasets.md](https://github.com/CodeNeuro/neurofinder/blob/master/local/datasets.md). You can also view them at [datasets.codeneuro.org](http://datasets.codeneuro.org).

Each download also includes example loading scripts in `python` and `MATLAB`, the source code of which are in the [neurofinder](https://github.com/CodeNeuro/neurofinder) repostiory. If you want to contribute example loading scripts for other languages, just submit a pull request!
